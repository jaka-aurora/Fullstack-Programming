        // parameters are given to the callback in line 2. Since myFunc is the third parameter of the first function, it is called as callback
        // and 'ham' and 'cheese' are passed as it's arguments in line 5 which return the string.
        // This is saved as a variable 'result' which is then logged with console.log in line 7.
